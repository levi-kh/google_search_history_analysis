# Google Search History Analysis 

This is a small personal project where I explore what can be inferred about someone based on their Google search history.

I used a fictional dataset (400 search queries over 3 months) to practice behavioral analysis, looking at daily routines, interests, lifestyle, even personality traits. Yes, of course, everything here is just for fun and learning, not meant to be 100% accurate.

The goal was to challenge myself: How much can we guess about someone just from what they search?

Tools used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Notion (for report)
- GitHub (you're here!)
